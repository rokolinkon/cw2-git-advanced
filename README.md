# Git Advanced
## Welcome
Welcome to the sequel tutorial to Git Basics! This is a companion to the PowerPoint presentation which will go over actually _performing_ all of the Git operations gone over in that presentation. Everything from branching to stashingâ€”we'll go over that here. Have the GitHub page for your forked repository open, because you'll be making a lot of changes both locally and remotely!
